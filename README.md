# Bhava_copy
This is the simple Flask web application where we can see the stocks of the different company where it is updated every day.But in your project we have used 'MYSQL DATABASE' that sake we have to update the stocks every day to the 'MYSQL DATABASE' for updating the database i have written the python code where the file name is 'insert.py' in that file where we have to mention the file path that we have downloaded from google through this link https://www.bseindia.com/markets/MarketInfo/BhavCopy.aspx in that link we have download only "Equity" file only then specify the path it will get uploaded into 'MYSQL DATABASE'.
I also impoerted the Database u have to export that database into your 'MYSQL DATABASE'.
After that for running the flask web application. We have to create the "VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT" by using the command 'mkvirtualenv' then activate the 'VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT' then run flask app.
By using the command 'python main.py'
After running that we will get the address HTTP then we have to copy that address and paste in chrome browser then the appliction will run.
